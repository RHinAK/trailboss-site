    <p class="updated">Last updated: January 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>TrailBoss ("the App") is developed by StackStats Apps LLC ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use TrailBoss.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect personal information.</strong> TrailBoss is designed with privacy as a core principle:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Trip data</strong> (trip names, locations, dates, notes, participants) — stored locally on your device only</li>
        <li><strong>Gear checklists</strong> — stored locally on your device only</li>
        <li><strong>Activity logs</strong> — stored locally on your device only</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency contacts</strong> — stored locally on your device only</li>
        <li><strong>Settings and preferences</strong> — stored locally on your device only</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All app data is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. We do not operate servers that store your personal data. Your data stays on your device and in your iCloud account (if you have iCloud enabled for the app).</p>

    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>TrailBoss offers optional Pro subscriptions managed entirely through Apple's App Store. We do not process payments directly. Subscription management and billing are handled by Apple. Please refer to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a> for information about how Apple handles payment data.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>TrailBoss does not integrate third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. We do not share your data with any third parties.</p>

    <h2>Weather Data</h2>
    <p>Weather features in TrailBoss may use Apple's WeatherKit or similar services to display weather information. Location data used for weather queries is not stored or transmitted to our servers.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>TrailBoss does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The app is rated 4+ and does not contain objectionable content.</p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can delete all your data at any time through the app's Settings > Manage Data section. Uninstalling the app will also remove all locally stored data.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
